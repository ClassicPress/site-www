WPScan WordPress Security Scanner - Scans your system for security vulnerabilities listed in the WPScan Vulnerability Database.

== Description ==

The WPScan WordPress Security Scanner plugin scans your system on a daily basis to find security vulnerabilities listed in the [WPScan Vulnerability Database](https://wpvulndb.com/). It shows an icon on the Admin Toolbar with the total number of security vulnerabilities found.

The [WPScan Vulnerability Database](https://wpvulndb.com/) is a WordPress vulnerability database, which includes WordPress core vulnerabilities, plugin vulnerabilities and theme vulnerabilities. The database is maintained by the WPScan Team, who are 100% focused on WordPress security.

To use the WPScan WordPress Security Plugin you will need to use a free API token by [registering here](https://wpvulndb.com/).

= What does the plugin do? =

* Scans the WordPress core, plugins and themes for known security vulnerabilities;
* Shows an icon on the Admin Toolbar with the total number of security vulnerabilities found;
* Notifies you by mail when new security vulnerabilities are found.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wpscan.zip` content to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. [Register](https://wpvulndb.com/users/sign_up) for a free API token
4. Save the API token to the WPScan settings page or within the wp-config.php file

== FAQ ==

* How can I configure the API token in the wp-config.php file?

To configure your API token in the wp-config.php file, use the following PHP code: `define( 'WPSCAN_API_TOKEN', '$your_api_token' );`

* How many API calls are made?

  There is one API call made for the WordPress version, one call for each installed plugin and one for each theme. By default there is one scan per day. The number of daily scans can be configured when configuring notifications.

* Why is the "Summary" section and the "Check Now" button not showing?

  The cron job did not run, which can be due to:
    - The DISABLE_WP_CRON constant is set to true in the wp-config.php file, but no system cron has been set (crontab -e).
    - A plugin's caching pages is enabled (see https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/93570/wp-cron-doesnt-execute-when-time-elapses?answertab=active#tab-top).
    - The blog is unable to make a loopback request, see the Tools->Site Health for details.
  If the issue can not be solved with the above, putting define('ALTERNATE_WP_CRON', true); in the wp-config.php
  could help, however, will reduce the SEO of the blog.
