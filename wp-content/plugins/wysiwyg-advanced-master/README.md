# Advanced WYSIWYG Editor for ClassicPress 1.x.x
The **WYSIWYG Advanced** plugin adds lots of additional options to the ClassicPress visual editor. This plugin is a fork of [TinyMCE Advanced v4.8](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-advanced/) for WordPress and contains no Gutenberg code.

# Pre-Installation
If you already have TinyMCE Advanced installed, you will need to deactivate and delete it before installing WYSIWYG Advanced. If you want to preserve your current editor settings, you can export them to a text file before deleting the plugin. You can then import those settings back into WYSIWYG Advanced after you get it installed.

# Installation
1. Download the [package](https://github.com/johnalarcon/wysiwyg-advanced/archive/master.zip) to your local computer.
2. Navigate to `Dashboard > Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin` and upload the file you downloaded.
3. Install, then activate.
4. Settings are located under `Dashboard > Tools > WYSIWYG`

# Compatibility
Compatible with ClassicPress 1.x.x. It should also continue to work on WordPress 4.9.x installations without any problem. PHP 7.3 ready.

# Contributing
