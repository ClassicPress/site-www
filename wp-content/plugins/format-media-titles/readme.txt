Automatically formats the title (and optionally the ALT field) for new media uploads. No need to manually edit the title anymore every time you upload an image!

== Description ==

Format Media Titles WordPress plugin allows you to format titles for newly uploaded media items. It can be pretty tedious to have to manually edit the title for newly uploaded media items. This Plugin automates things by removing and replacing characters from the title such as hyphens, and underscores, with spaces. The title can then be capitalized by a method of your choice:

* First letter of each word capitalized.
* First letter of first word capitalized only.
* All letters made uppercase.
* All letter made lower case.
* No capitalization. Title remains unchanged.

You will especially benefit from this Plugin if your media files have descriptive names, as you won't have to manually edit them at all after uploading them!

As well as formatting the title for newly uploaded media items, you can also optionally copy the formatted title to the ALT, and description fields too, via plugin settings.
